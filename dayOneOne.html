    <!-- <h1>What appears like a net of skin emerges</h1> -->
    <p id="paragraphText" class="hidden">it hurts and you make a face, mouth open with the pain as what is like a net of skin slowly splays out from you and melds at the edges with the bark of the tree. You suck *something* from it and feel it coursing though you, arms hanging limp beside your sagging torso fixed at the waist to your stiffened legs. All you see is throbbing colour until the ----- begins to retract. The only trace of the appendage a callous ring mark where it had re-combined with the skin of your body and the sensation of *something* inside. </p>
